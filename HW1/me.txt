Hi, I'm Hamza. My intended major is Chemical Engineering, but I find CS interesting so I decided to take the course.
 I've been at Georgia Tech for about a semester at this point and it's been pretty fulfilling so far (I look forward to meeting a lot of new faces).
 I don't have a different preferred name from the one in Canvas.
